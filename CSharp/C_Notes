void  no output
int   int output

NUMERTICLY ACCESSABLE [0]:
Arrays
string[] names = new string[4];
string names = {"john", "jerry", "Kevin", "fred"} 
names[0] = "John"; // lets you declare or redeclare
names[1] = "Fred";
names[2] = "Jerry";
names[3] = "Kevin";

List like an array but can fluctuate in size
// its a lot like an object
List<string> groceryList = new List<string> {}; //list with nothing in its
// use Add() to add items
groceryList.Add("spaghetti");
// to swap out a new string
groceryList[0] = "new item";
// to REMOVE
groceryList.Remove("candy!") also returns a true false if it worked

DICTIONARIES hold key-value pairs
// Create an empty Dictionary
Dictionary<string, string> myDictionary = new Dictionary() {}
Dictionary<string, string> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>() {{"a", "apple"}, {"B", "bear"}}
// first value is now searchable for second value
myDictionary["a"]
// to add
myDictionary["c"] = "cat"

Iteration Statments

// for accessing private data within a class object
Getter methods just pules the property from the class
GetNameOfProperty()
Getters return something

// uses a method to set private data within a Class
Setter methods
setters do not return something and are Void

Static Methods //both methods and variables must be static
Private Methods need to be accessed with public methods
Static Variables will relate to the entire class

Objects 
Objects have fields private
Fields are accessed by properties which are public methods
Instance Method--belong to the object
  (static methods)
  car price each is different

interface blueprint
IDisposable interface

try
{
  code that might break
