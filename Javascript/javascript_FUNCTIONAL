Object oriented programing
-inheritance,
-encapsulation
Functional programing
-stateless doesn't store information
-composition 
-always returns something
-never mutates a variable (well...)


Pure functions == always the same output from an input | never do anything outside the function
First class functions == store functions in a variable, pass functions into functions, return functions
  callbacks 
  higher order functions call other functions
  callInnerFunction()();
Higher order functions
Immutability == don't change your state | always const 
Closures inner function that has access to variables from an outer function
  A way of allowing variables inside functions to persist by storing the function in a variable 
Currying functions == takes a function with multiple arguments and rewrites
  Allows flexibility in how variables are called, longer to write, shorter to use
Recursion
Composition over inheritance
