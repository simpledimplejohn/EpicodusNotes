App template creator:
  `create-react-app` tool
  use command:
  `npx create-react-app help-queue` 
  -npx also bundles npm inside it
  -will still use npm for managing packages
    NOTE: using this command automatically downloads latest REACT version
    If you need to load an earlier version of REACT for compatability use:
      `npm install --save-exact react-scripts@3.2.0` to specify version
